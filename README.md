# Stockx-scraping-tool

Used selenium, beautifulSoup and pandas packages, between many others in order to retrieve dynamic data from a webpage.
This dynamic data were the prices at which last 10 items were sold worldwide. Some operations were done and the results were automatically stored in
an excel file.

Unfortunately, this script was wrote in 2019-2020 and the format of the website has changed. The data scraping part of the tool does not work anymore and has to be updated.
